# Prettify JSON Without Wasting Space

JSON "prettifiers" produce unnecessarily long JSON...

Sounds familiar? This VS Code extension does the right thing by formatting your code snippets in a compact, but still pretty form.

## Usage:

1. Select a JSON text in any file type, 
2. Invoke command runner (with Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
3. Type command name: `Format: Compact Pretty JSON`

Enjoy.

## Command Installed:

`Format: Compact Pretty JSON`
